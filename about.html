      <section class="about-section">
        <p>
          My name is Tanaro Sch√§dler, and I am a computer science graduate.
          While I wrote my Bachelor's thesis on the topic of Zero Trust
          Security, I switched my focus to Machine Learning and Artificial
          Intelligence during my Master's studies. I am passionate about using
          technology to solve real-world problems and am excited to pursue a
          career in the field of data science and machine learning.</p>
          <p>But I am also interested in software development and cybersecurity, as well as
          system administration. In my free time, I enjoy pursuing these fields
          about computers and servers as a hobby. Aside from computers, I like
          to boulder with friends, enjoy nature, and go hiking in the mountains
          or cycling along the Danube.

            <h3>VLM UI: Vision Language Model User Interface</h3>
            <p>
              VLM UI is a pioneering web-based user interface designed for efficient interaction with Vision Language Models (VLMs). Unlike existing tools for Large Language Models (LLMs), VLM UI fills a gap in the market by providing:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>User-friendly frontend for multiple VLMs</li>
              <li>Current support for PaliGemma, Phi3-Vision, and Florence-2</li>
              <li>Plans for integration with additional VLMs</li>
              <li>Complementary Command Line Interface (CLI) for task automation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This project evolved from separate UIs for PaliGemma and Phi3-Vision, which are available on GitHub. VLM UI is a personal project that I'm developing independently in my free time, aimed at enhancing accessibility and usability in the growing field of vision-language AI.

            <h3>DVS 3: Student Union Printing System Management Tool</h3>
            <p>
              DVS 3 is a comprehensive web-based management tool for our university's student union printing system. This project represents a complete rewrite of the previous PHP-based DVS 2 system, with significant enhancements:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Developed using Python with the Django framework</li>
              <li>React-based frontend for improved user experience</li>
              <li>New functionalities: e.g. LDAP integration and enhanced inventory management</li>
              <li>Collaborative effort with three other students</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              My primary contributions to this team project include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Payment processing, including state flow management</li>
              <li>Authentication system implementation (frontend and backend)</li>
              <li>LaTeX-based document generation and email notification</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This project increased my proficiency in full-stack web development, team collaboration, and creating practical solutions for real-world organizational needs.

            <h3>Connected Lamps Project</h3>
            <p>
              Inspired by the K-drama "I'm Not a Robot," I developed a pair of
              internet-connected lamps. Key features include:
              <ul>
                <li>ESP32 microcontroller-based, programmed in C++ using PlatformIO</li>
                <li>Dual control options: physical buttons or custom Android app written in Kotlin</li>
                <li>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity between app and ESP32s</li>
                <li>Original ESP-BLE interface code published on <a href="https://github.com/TanaroSch/android-esp32-ble">GitHub</a> as an open-source template</li>
                <li>Lamps interconnected via WebSocket server</li>
              </ul>
              This project helped me develop my skills in IoT development, mobile app creation, and even led to open-source contribution.
